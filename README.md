# <<----------------concepts learned throughout the project------------>>

 1. (*) the catch-all or fallback route (<Route path="*">) is there to handle URLs that don't match any of your explicitly defined routes. Bascially it makes our application user friendly where even after not matching the exact path , user will be able to see a default page

This route is often used as a catch-all or fallback route. It will match any URL path that hasn't been matched by the preceding routes. Without this catch-all route, if a user enters a URL that doesn't match any defined route, React Router may issue a warning or not render anything.

2. from next time , if i will not have any subroutes then i will gonna write all the route in the  appjs file of the react application. from next time does not matter how many route you have try to declare them in the appjs where your main root of the routers lies
